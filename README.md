This is the practical part of my bachelor's thesis: "Segmentation of Multivariate Time Series Data in Manufacturing Technology Using Machine Sensor Data as an Example".
To begin with the segmentation of processes, the data must be loaded into the workspace using the data_loader. 
If new processes are to be segmented, an appropriate enum must also be created.
